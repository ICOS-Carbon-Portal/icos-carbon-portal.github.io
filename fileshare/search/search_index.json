Install authenticator app If you already have two-factor authentication set up, you may be able to use your existing app for Fileshare as well. Fileshare is compatible with any time-based one-time password (TOTP) authenticator. Here is a list of some compatible apps, which can be installed on both Android and iOS devices: Microsoft Authenticator Google Authenticator Bitwarden Set up two-factor authentication on Fileshare You can click on Security settings page to access it, or click on your profile picture in the upper right corner, then Personal settings , then Security \u00edn the left pane. Check the checkbox next to Enable TOTP to set up two-factor authentication. A secret will be displayed, along with a QR code; the easiest way to set up 2FA is to scan the QR code with your authenticator app. Depending on the app and your device, the process will vary. Here is an example using the Microsoft Authenticator app on an iPhone: Open the app, and then tap on the QR code icon in the lower right corner of the screen. If necessary, give the app permission to use your camera. Scan the QR code. Your account is now set up.

Use backup codes Below the TOTP (Authenticator app) section on the Security settings page , there is an option called Backup code . If you click on the button to generate backup codes, you will be provided with 10 codes.

You can save these somewhere secure (for example, another cloud storage service or a secure password manager, or written down at your desk) just in case you need them, and you don't need to save all ten.
